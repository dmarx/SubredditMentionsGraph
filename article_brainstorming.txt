* Introduce a novel dataset
  --> TO DO: 
    - Basic graph statistics (see below)
    - post to figshare
* Demonstrate that the activity in this dataset is a good proxy for global activity
  --> TO DO: 
    - compare graph statistics to those observed by rhiever
      - number of nodes
      - number of edges
      - clustering coefficient
      - # of communities
      - power law fit
      - avg shortest path length
      - modularity
      - small-worldness score
    - Compare counts of unique active user in the mentions data vs. the public comments dataset
* Community detection
      - Compare communities to rhievers communities
* Novel graph analysis of reddit (as a dynamic rather than a static graph)
* Apply graph anomaly detection to highlight periods of instability
* Demonstrate the effect this instability has had on the growth rate of the community graph and the active population
  - Accelerated rate of decline of active population
  - Subreddit graph flipped from slowly growing to more rapidly shrinking
  
Discussion
* ?

Conclusions
* Support scan statistic method for anomaly detection
* The events of 2015 have had a significant impact both on the magnitude and the topology of the reddit community
