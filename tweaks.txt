node*: 
Balls represent subreddits.

edge*: 
Connections represent relationships inferred from "subreddit mentions" in comments (via /r/<subredditName> syntax).

color*:
Colors highlight communities of related subreddits identified algorithmically.

Title*:
<h2>Reddit Community Structure</h2>

Short Description*:
<br><br><h3>Summary</h3><br>

A visualization of the community structure of reddit inferred from how subreddits are talked about across the website.

<br><br><h3>Methodology</h3><br>

Reddit comments were monitored for several months looking for references to subreddits (via "/r/subedditName" markdown syntax) in reddit comments. 
Counts of the numbers of users who mentioned a given subreddit in comments submitted to another subreddit were treated as "votes" in favor of the existence of a (directed) 
relationship between the subreddit in which the comment occurred (source) and the mentioned subreddit (target). 
Only relationships with at least 3 "votes" were considered strong enough to appear in this visualization

Long Description*:
<br><h3>Summary</h3><br>

A visualization of the community structure of reddit inferred from how subreddits are talked about across the website.

<br><h3>Methodology</h3><br>

Reddit comments were monitored for several months looking for references to subreddits (via "/r/subedditName" markdown syntax) in reddit comments. 
Counts of the numbers of users who mentioned a given subreddit in comments submitted to another subreddit were treated as "votes" in favor of the existence of a (directed) 
relationship between the subreddit in which the comment occurred (source) and the mentioned subreddit (target). 
Only relationships with at least 3 "votes" were considered strong enough to appear in this visualization

<br><br>

NB: At no point is any confirmation performed to validate that a mentioned subreddits is in fact a valid subreddit. The consequence is that some subreddits
that appear in this visualization are not actually subreddits (e.g. /r/all), are no longer active (e.g. /r/jailbait, /r/fatpeoplehate), are unresolved aliases
for other subeddits (e.g. /r/lol -> /r/leagueoflegends), mispellings of valid subreddits (/r/millionaremakers), or may be subreddit names used as though they 
were "hashtags" (e.g. /r/thathappened). For the most part, the occurrence of invalid subreddits is largely mitigated by the "voting" approach taken in this analysis.

<br><br><h3>Technical Details</h3><br><br>

The graph layout was calculated using gephi's Force Atlas 2 algorithm with LinLog mode activated and the "Prevent Overlap" option added after the layout had stabilized. 
The graph was then exported to a webapp using the SigmaJs Exporter plugin (provided graciously by the Oxford Internet Institute), and then a few configuration parameters
were adjusted manually to finish the visualization.

<br><br>

The data set can also be explored at http://subredditmentions.com, a webapp by the author of this visualization which visualizes 
occurences of subreddit mentions overlaid on top of the traffic statistics for the "mentioned" subreddit.


Hover Behavior :None
Group Selector: None (could make this modularity class or color)
Image Attribute: None

Too much text, hides search bar. Need to shorten copy.s

in config.json:

minNodeSize: 0.07
maxNodeSize: 4
minEdgeSize:0.5
maxEdgeSize: 2
maxRatio: 80
labelThreshold: 7 # *might* be better as 8? Whatever. It's subtle.

To change background color, modify background attribute of .fancybox-skin class in jquery.fancybox.css

.fancybox-skin

Additionally, edit the <title> div to provide an actual title for the webpage.

>>Ensure subredditmentions.com can be taken down if it gets too expensive (it will).<<

Take subredditmentions off of debug mode, investigate potential security holes in file/folder permissions.

Finish upgrades to subredditmentions (permalinking view pages, constraining search to single mentions box)

Add an "explore" hyperlink that links to this visualization

Node attributes to fold in:
    * # subscribers
    * Avg uniques/hr (if this is something I even can find)
    * NSFW
    * Subreddit created date
    --> Which of these attributes can I fold in from that giant subreddits dataset?
    
Add hosting for the raw dataset, separate post to /r/datasets
